            in performance of their obligations under these Terms.</p>
            <p>Service Provider may prescribe from time to time with regard to the Services.
                All Transactions effected by or through this Website, shall constitute legally
                binding and valid transactions when done in adherence to and in compliance
                with the terms and conditions prescribed by Open or Seller/ Service Provider.</p>

            <strong>Confidentiality</strong>
            <p>User agrees not to disclose or attempt to use or personally benefit from any
                non-public information that he may learn on the Website or through the
                Services. This obligation shall continue until such time as the non-public
                information has become publicly known through no action of your own. If you
                are compelled by order of a court or other governmental or legal body (or
                have notice that such an order is being sought) to divulge any such non-public
                information, you agree to promptly and diligently notify Open and cooperate
                fully with Open in protecting such information to the extent possible under
                applicable law.</p>

            <p>Open may access, preserve and disclose any of your information if required to
                do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary to</p>

            <p>(i) respond to claims asserted against Open or to comply with legal process,</p>
            <p>(ii) for fraud prevention, risk product development and
                assessment, investigation, customer support, de-bugging
                purposes,</p>
            <p>(iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Open, its Users
                or members of the public.</p>

            <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>
            <p>User fully acknowledges and agrees that, to the maximum extent permitted by
                law, the complete risk arising out of your access to and use of the website
                and services remains with you.
                Neither Open nor any other party involved in

                or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or
                the cost of substitute services, or in connection with these terms, as a result
                of your use of the website or services, whether based on warranty, contract,
                tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and
                whether or not open has been informed of the possibility of such damage,
                even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its
                essential purpose.</p>

            <strong>General Terms</strong>

                or charges. The User agrees to pay all fees and charges so imposed provided
                there is an intimation of the fees prior to the charge.

            <p>Open or Service Provider shall in no event be liable to a User or any third
                party for any loss or damage whatsoever or howsoever caused arising directly
                or indirectly in connection with the Website and Services.</p>
            <p>In no event shall Open or a Service Provider be liable to a User or any other
                third party for any applicable taxes and government levies.</p>
            <p>Any link on the Open Website to a third party site is not an endorsement of
                that Website. The use or browsing by a User of any other Website shall be
                subject to the terms and conditions in each such Website.</p>
            <p>Open does not endorse any advertiser or merchant linked to its Website. It
                shall be User’s responsibility to check and verify all information provided bythe merchants/ advertisers before arriving at a conclusion to purchase any
                Product.</p>
            <p>Open shall not be responsible for any unauthorized access to the User’s data

                representations to any customer or any third party or give any
                warranties, which may require Open or Service Provider to undertake
                to or be liable for, be it directly or indirectly, any obligation
                and/or responsibility to customer or any third party Open shall not
                be responsible for any violatation of these Terms due to any
                force-majeure event such as act of god, fire, lightning, explosion,
                flood, inclement weather conditions, power failures, failure in any
                communication systems, equipment breakdown, strikes, lock-out or any
                other cause beyond the control of Open.</p>
            <p>If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or
                unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited
                to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth
                herein, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
                superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
                matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of
                the Terms shall continue in effect.</p>
